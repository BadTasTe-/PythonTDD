#Bad thought that he should enter a to-do item right now

#He types "Continue with Node.js"

# after entering enter, the page is being refreshed and 
#the new item is being shown.

#That's cool, so bad decide to add another one:
#This time he chooses "Go go go with Golang but don't forget
# the pythonÂ¡s goat!"

#another update of the page and it's now showing both items.

#Bad is now being suspicious, does the web page will remember his list?
#Apparently, a unique URL has been generated, let's try out

#Indeed, visiting this URL show me my to-do list.

#satisfied, Bad decides to go back to it's python's goat.
